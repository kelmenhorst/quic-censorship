The [measurement list](measurement_list.csv) contains all HTTP/3 measurements taken with OONI's experimental network test `urlgetter`. If you want to search for and evaluate HTTP/3 measurements yourself, check out [kelmenhorst/http3-toolchain](https://github.com/kelmenhorst/http3-toolchain) or the easy to use [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1d-UWvDsAHLGFwY583J9kckCfBJfdpmh6?usp=sharing).
